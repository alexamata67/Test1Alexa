                A transistor is a semiconductor device that can amplify or switch electrical signals and power1234. It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics23. It has three terminals called emitter, base, and collector24. It is made of two semiconductor materials, usually silicon, with opposite properties, known as p-type and n-type154. When the two materials are placed together, they form a barrier that can be controlled by applying voltage to the base5.

The MC6800 microprocessor was part of the M6800 Microcomputer System (latter dubbed 68xx[1]) that also included serial and parallel interface ICs, RAM, ROM and other support chips. A significant design feature was that the M6800 family of ICs required only a single five-volt power supply at a time when most other microprocessors required three voltages.</td>

It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics.[1] It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more in miniature form are found embedded in integrated circuits. Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics, many people consider them one of the 20th century's greatest inventions.</td>
